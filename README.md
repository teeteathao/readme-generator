# Professional README Generator

## Description

Every project needs a quality README file with information about the application. The README file will include a description of the project/application, how to use the application, how to install it, and how developers could make contributions to your project.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named '_README.md'

## Usage
